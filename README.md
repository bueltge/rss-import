# RSSImport

A WordPress plugin that display feeds on your blog, using PHP in your templates or Shortcode in your posts and pages.

## Description
Display feeds in your blog, using PHP, a Widget or Shortcode. The plugin uses only standard WordPress functionality, so no external libraries are required. For older versions of WordPress, the built-in [MagpieRSS library](https://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) is used. For WordPress 2.8 and newer, there is a setting available to enable the built-in [SimplePie library](https://simplepie.org/) for parsing feeds.

As with all other content you publish, make sure you are allowed to (re-)publish the content of the feeds you are about to import!

## License
Good news, this plugin is free for everyone! Since it's released under the GPL, you can use it free of charge on your personal or commercial blog.
